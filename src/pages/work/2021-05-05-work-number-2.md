  In memory of Lee Young-Jun’s death, I created a personal memorial book containing writings and drawings. The writing is a letter addressed to the already deceased Lee, reflecting on his death through the recent reading of *The Unavowable Community* by the French writer Maurice Blanchot.


  After moving to Berlin in 2018, I met Lee Young-Jun, a first generation migrant from S. Korea to Germany as a miner in the 1960s.\

  In June 1989, Lee arranged a secretive operation to send the activist of the National Council of Student Representatives, Lim Su-Kyung to North Korea to attend the *13th World Festival of Youth and Students* without the travel permission from the South Korean government. Her visit triggered a public controversy and hope for the reunification of Koreas when the Cold War tension between North and South was at its height.
